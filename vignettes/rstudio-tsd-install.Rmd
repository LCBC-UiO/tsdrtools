While installing RStudio is not like installing a package, so this package it self cannot help you with that.
However, since RStudio has become the most used IDE for R, and is not readily available on TSD, we have compiled here a tutorial on how to get Rstudio working for your TSD project. 

## Switching to RHEL7
By default all new TSD linux users are allocated a Virtual Machine (VM) using Redhat 6. 
Unfortunately, there is just a single, very old RStudio that works on this VM. 
Contact USIT and request that all users on your project be moved to RHEL7 (you can also do this for insgle users if you dont want to move all).
Remember that new users will still be allocated a RHEL6 VM, so when you get new coworkers, make sure they are given the correct VM from the start, or else RStudio will not work for them.

## Get the latest RStudio
Go to [Rstudio's webpages](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)  and download the latest version availale for Fedora 19/Red Hat 7. 
Import this file into TSD for install. 


```{bash}
# Make a folder for common tools for your project, with a subfolder for rstudio
mkdir -p /cluster/projects/pXXX/tools/rstudio

# Install the rstudio version into a specific file
# Nothe the version number will change over time
rpm --prefix=/cluster/projects/pXXX/tools/rstudio  rstudio-1.3.1073-x86_64.rpm
```

There should now be a folder `/cluster/projects/pXXX/tools/rstudio/rstudio-1.3.1073`. 

## create alias to open rstudio.
Now that RStudio exists on the system, your users need to be able to open the program from the terminal. 
To do so, you need to make the RStudio executable file available to them. 

This means that users need to place the following line in their `.bash_profile` to make it available to them

```{bash}
alias rstudio=/cluster/projects/pXXX/tools/rstudio/rstudio-1.3.1073/bin/rstudio
```

Saving this in `$HOME/.bash_profile`, restarting a terminal, and now Rstudio should be available by terminal command `rstudio`. 

If you still cannot make it work with these steps, report an [issue](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/tsdrtools/issues).
If you know of additional needed steps for successful install, either do a direct PR for adding that information to this document, or , report an [issue](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/tsdrtools/issues).
We'd love feedback to improve the instructions!
